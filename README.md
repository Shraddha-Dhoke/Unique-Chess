# Project Screenshots
Project screenshots are in Screenshots folder

# Project Explaination
This project contains a form which has an input selection field. There are 3 grid sizes (2x2, 3x3 and 2x3). When the user selects a grid size and clicks on the Submit button a grid is created which is of the selected size. Each block has different colors and icons on it.

# Incomplete tasks
The drag, drop and replace functionality of the icons on the grid is incomplete as it was new to me and took time in research.
